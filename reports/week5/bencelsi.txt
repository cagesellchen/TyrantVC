CSE 403
February 4th, 2019
Individual Status Report

Section 1:
	In the coming week, I will meet with my team to formally define our roles and 
	tasks, split the project into manageable pieces.  I will also work more on 
	writing scripts in Maya, and research Maya's API for creating plugins and its
	abilities
Section 2:
	This week, I met with my team to create a detailed feature list, and formerly define the behavior
	of our UI.  We also chose our technologies (PyQT for frontend, PyMEL/Git for backend, and Python to
	connect them) 
	We also split into 2 teams: front end (Carson and myself) and back end (Vlad and Annie)
	Unfortunately I haven't started using Maya yet, however I only just was assigned to the frontend
	team so I now have a more clear idea of what I need to work on.
Section 3:
	In the coming week, I will research PyQT, and meet with Carson to start development on our front
	end application.  We will also work with the backend team to create a more formal specification.
