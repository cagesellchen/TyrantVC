Individual Status Report 

Section 1:
	[First Week]
Section 2:
•	This week, I helped write our team’s project proposal. 
•	I created our team’s GitHub.
Section 3:
•	In the coming week, I plan to help our team create the project spec as well as design the architecture and implementation plan for our project. It’s important that we start out with a solid plan in order to ensure our project is completed on time. 
•	I will download and familiarize myself with Maya, the platform that we are creating a plugin for. I need to get up to speed with how its scripting platform works so that I am comfortable when we begin implementation.
