Individual Status Report

Section 1:
In the coming week, I plan on presenting with Annie, working on the user manual, specifically on modifying so it fits our
target audience's needs. I also plan on starting the implementation process for the backend of our project, more 
specifically the gitaccess component.
  
Section 2:
This week, I updated the presentation, and presented it with Annie. I also wrote the first half of the user manual and edited
the project proposal. I've discussed implementation and testing strategies of gitaccess with Annie and implemented a repo methods
and wrote the test suite.
  
Section 3:
This coming week I am planning on adding any missing functionality to GitAcces, creating documentation for running the tests in Maya
installing the plugin, and beginning to work on the middleman classes which require the MainPanel class from the FrontEnd team.
