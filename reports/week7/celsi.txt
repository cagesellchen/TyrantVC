Individual Status Report

Section 1:
Next week we will begin implementation.  I will start working with PyQT and the team will set up our 
environment within our repo.

Section 2:
This past week, I added a frontend directory to our repo, started started playing around with various 
APIs, not specifically working on implementating or software, but using widgets and layouts.  Through
this process I decided not to use PyQt, but instead to use a very similar API called PySide. The 
advantage of PySide is that it is included with Maya, so no additional installations are necessary.

Section 3:
Next week I will continue to work in PySide, meet with Carson to co-ordinate our strategy to tackle the
frontend, and implement a rough version of our frontend layout.
