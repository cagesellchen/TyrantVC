Individual Status Report

Section 1:
	In the coming week, I will attend our team meeting where we will define the architecture of our project and split into 
  two smaller teams. Then I will work on my smaller team to fill in our part of the project report.
  
Section 2:
	This week I participated in our team meeting and helped create the UML diagram and define the architecture of our project.
  I also worked with Annie to create the first presentation for Friday, but it was postponed. 
  
  
Section 3:
	In the coming week, I plan on presenting with Annie, working on the user manual, specifically on modifying so it fits our
  target audience's needs. I also plan on starting the implementation process for the backend of our project, more 
  specifically the gitaccess component.
