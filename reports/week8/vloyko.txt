Individual Status Report

Section 1:
This coming week I am planning on adding any missing functionality to GitAcces, creating documentation for running the tests in Maya
installing the plugin, and beginning to work on the middleman classes which require the MainPanel class from the FrontEnd team.
  
Section 2:
This week I finished GitAccess, wrote tests for them, implemented CI for the project. During our big push session on Sunday I refactored
the repo and added aditional scripts including tyrantvc.py and install_plugin.py to make the plugin easily installable and so the file
strucutre makes sense and is interpertable by Maya. I also worked on connecting main_panel and stagingUI to git access, preparing the plugin
for a user study.
  
Section 3:
I need to draft up instructions for the user study and adjust the instructions for the windows machines in the animation labs. Along with that
there are still features that I want to add, like being able to select which exact files we want to commit. Finally I need to run the user study and
continue implementing features described in the report, such as being able to view history of the repo or individual files.
