Weekly Status Report

Section 1:
Next week I will continue to work in PySide, meet with Carson to co-ordinate our strategy to tackle the
frontend, and implement a rough version of our frontend layout.

Section 2:
Last week, I continued researching PySide2 and I met with the whole group to quickly ramp up our implementation efforts.
I worked on the StagingUI component of our frontend development, figured out how Maya handles plugins, and our strategy for installation/integration with the plugin manager.

Section 3:
This coming week, I will continue to work on frontend development: 
adding the checkbox functionality to StagingUI, adding our frontend element for displaying past commits, and using the frontend to call our backend git_access file.
