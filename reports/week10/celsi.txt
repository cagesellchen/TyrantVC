Weekly Status Report

Section 1:
Next week, I will work on the commit tab, incorporate our config file into the frontend, and separate the file tab and commit tab into 2 separate classes.

Section 2:
Last week, I made our team report and feedback for Proj 7.  I didn't split the commit and file tabs into separate classes, but I did refactor them within main_panel.py


Section 3:
Next week, I will work on finalizing our report.  We have a few 'nice to have' features that I might work on as well- allowing adding/deleting files/folders from the filetab, 
opening a commit list from the file tab, reformatting the ui of the commit tab are all possible. We can go over this in the meeting on Thursday.
