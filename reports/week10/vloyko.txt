Individual Status Report

Section 1:
Next week I plan on running one more user study, writing more tests, specifically for config_access and 
cleaning up the report for the final submission.
  
Section 2:
This week I have written the tests for the config_access file as well as sorted out some issues with git_access tests.
I also constructed a second user study which involved creating new instructions as well as creating a google form that 
survey takers would be able to fill out after they complete the instructions. Sadly everyone in the Animation lab was too busy
to take the longer study so we will have to rely on the smaller studies.
  
Section 3:
Run the final user study and include the results in the report. Make any changes to the final submission of the report 
if appropriate.
