Individual Status Report

Section 1:
	This coming week, I will continue working on the front end, filling out the commits tab on
	the UI and updating any additional pieces that need to be fixed. Additionally, I will help
	respond to the feedback received from the presentation, especially regarding git diff.

Section 2: 
	This week, I continued working on the front end, doing the commits tab and hooking it up to
	the backend so that it displayed the commits properly as well as lists the files. Also fixed
	some issues that git_access was having on Windows.
	
Section 3:
	This coming week, I will polish the UI if necessary and help run user studies, as well as
	help write the final report and make the final presentation.
