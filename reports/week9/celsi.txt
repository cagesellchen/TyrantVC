Weekly Status Report

Section 1:
This coming week, I will continue to work on frontend development: 
adding the checkbox functionality to StagingUI, adding our frontend element for displaying past commits, and using the frontend to call our backend git_access file.

Section 2:
Last week, I fixed issues with main_panel, like adding error messages on creating duplicate projects, committing with no modifications or no projects, and updating 
the file view on project changes.  I also added checkboxes to StagingUI, and fixed a bug that allowed duplicate StagingUIs.  I also gave our team presentation with 
Carson on Friday.

Section 3:
Next week, I will work on the commit tab, incorporate our config file into the frontend, and separate the file tab and commit tab into 2 separate classes.
